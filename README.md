## Interview Question Central

Each directory is a collection of interview questions that NSS students and grads have encountered. There are written / verbal response questions for all subjects, as well as technical whiteboard questions for certain subjects.

The answers are not provided for any questions, so good luck! If a solution to a question cannot be found, be sure to do some research to find one.


#### Adding a question

Have a question that should be added? Open up a Pull Request and let's add it to the collection. Please follow the following format for adding a question:

1. Make sure it is not a duplicate / variation of any existing questions.
1. Provide an answer for the submitted question - the answer won't be added to the repo, but there needs to be a solution!
1. Submit questions as markdown files and make sure the subject / language of the question is clearly stated.
