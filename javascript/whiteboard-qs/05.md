#### ES6 Array Method Madness

Think about flexibility, composition, and not hard-coding values
programmatically. Use the sample data below for this exercise.

1. Tasks:
  - add a new key & value to each person
  - return only people with an age lower than their number
  - find the average age
  - write one function that can take other functions to facilitate doing all three


```js
const people = [
  { name: 'Abe', age: 60, number: 60 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 21, number: 92 },
  { name: 'Cat', age: 45, number: 41 },
  { name: 'Don', age: 14, number: 11 },
  { name: 'Edy', age: 39, number: 93 }
]
```
